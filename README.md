# CS-465-Full-Stack

<h2>Architecture</h2>
A full-stack MEAN project contains front-end development which includes server-side rendering with Express in which it is faster and provides less interactivity and reloading (SPA). With this, outcomes a dynamic, fast and interactive experience. NoSQL MongoDB is used in the backend for it's storage and querying. It is easy to integrate with JavaScript and the use of JSON makes translating flexible and scalable.


<h2>Functionality</h2>

JSON is light-weight and text-based to store and utilize data. Connecting to the backend SQL server, it ties together with the front-end with HTTP requests and is easy to fetch because of it's simplicity of data formation; key-value pairs, arrays, and nested structures.

Refactoring code was evident when creating reusable UI components. Using Express and Angular, creating the front-end and back-end with created and scalable components made the process more efficient. Although it got more and more complex, as the project got complex, it was scalable.

<h2>Testing</h2>

Using methods such as HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) were mainly used with interacting for front-end and back-end to perform actions that manipulate or move data. Endpoints such as an API endpoint are used to handle requests between the front-end and back-end such as requesting trips, updating and deleting them.
To handle access and security to these methods, I performed various for front-end and back-end to protect data and encryption such as authentication, authorization, and API security such as CORS. As long as there was authorized users with access, they had access to to the backend angular SPA.


<h2>Reflection</h2>
This course was very heavy, but it gave me a perspective on the whole process of doing front-end and back-end and how it all ties together to create a full working software. Multiple frameworks and trends are prevalent in the field of work and the project can be scaled for more features. With all the tools used and the understanding of the relationships between frameworks and proper coding standards, it is abundant and useful when applying myself to the career I strive for.
